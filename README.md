# Integrated-Assistive-Technology-System-for-Neurological-Disease-Patients
## Embedded Systems in Medical Equipment Course Project

This project provides an integrated system for assisting brain disease patients with moderate technology and employment of simple sensors.

It is divided to three modules, each targetting a specific symptom commonly among brain diseases:
1) Sialorrhoea Assistive Subsystem (Raindrop Water Sensor Module)
2) Hand-Vibration Assistive Subsystem (SW-420 Vibration Sensor Module)
3) Hearing Weakness Assistive Subsystem (Sound Detection Sensor Module)

Each is a control system providing input, output, conditioning and feedback. 

Project code is written in C for ATmega328P microcontroller in specific, employing LCD and keypad interfacing with AVR, AVR timer programming, AVR interrupt programming, ADC and sensor interfacing with AVR.

System detailed explanation, system flowchart, subsystem block diagrams, project code and circuit diagram are all provided in PDF document named: "Project Report.PDF"
